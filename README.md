The traditional method for sleep apnea diagnosis is a polysomnography (PSG) , or overnight sleep study, that is often conducted in a  hospital environment . 
This procedure can face a number of challenges:
Expensive: Since polysomnography requires specialist equipment and trained technicians, it is costly for patients as well as healthcare providers.

Restricted Accessibility: It is not feasible for individuals with mobility issues  to be able to spend the night at a sleep clinic, which is a common requirement for patients taking part in sleep studies. In addition, the limited number of sleep clinics may lead to prolonged wait times for visits.

Inconvenience : PSG involves connecting patients to a number of sensors in order to monitor their different physiological data. This might be an inconvenience and interfere with their regular sleep cycles. This new setting may have an impact on the study's accuracy.

The use of technology and machine learning is essential in offering additional  techniques for the diagnosis of sleep apnea. If compared to more conventional diagnostic methods like PSG, these developments have significant advantages in terms of accessibility, affordability, and patient convenience. 

Data Analysis and Pattern Recognition: Machine learning algorithms can prove to be highly efficient when it comes to the examination of large amounts of data to find patterns that may be difficult for people to notice. This feature enables the application of models that can recognise patterns associated with sleep apnea in a less invasive manner, such as heart rate, respiration , or any movement during sleep. 

Scalability and Accessibility: It is comparatively simpler to expand the reach of machine learning-based detection methods to a larger population. This scalability is essential to address the growing prevalence of sleep apnea and provide early diagnosis to those who might not have easy access to sleep clinics or  medical facilities.
